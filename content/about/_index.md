## Our History

Trostsville Primary School was established on January 1, 1981, with a vision to provide quality education to the children of Wolmaransstad and surrounding areas. Starting with just three classrooms and a handful of students, we have grown steadily over the past four decades.

In our early years, the school focused on building a strong foundation, emphasizing literacy and numeracy skills. By the 1990s, we had expanded our curriculum to include a broader range of subjects and extracurricular activities.

The turn of the millennium brought significant developments to our campus, including new facilities, technology integration, and enhanced teaching methodologies. Today, we stand proud as one of the leading primary schools in the region, with a reputation for academic excellence and holistic development.
